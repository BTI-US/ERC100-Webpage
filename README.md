## Introduction

In the current cryptocurrency market, fraud and chaos are rampant, greatly damaging investor confidence. Our project is dedicated to improving this situation through technical means, thereby restoring and enhancing user trust in the market. We propose an innovative solution that uses mathematical models to simulate and predict the most market-demanded trading curves, combined with matrix decomposition techniques to find the optimal solution, dynamically adapting to changes in market sentiment.

When the market is highly volatile and confidence is low, the system will automatically execute intelligent trading strategies to prevent a vicious cycle caused by panic selling; as market confidence gradually recovers, trading will be gradually opened to restore normal market liquidity. In this way, our project can achieve steady growth of the K-line, alleviate market volatility in a controlled manner, and create a more stable and predictable trading environment for users.

Our goal is to reduce uncertainty in trading through technological means, establish a trust-first cryptocurrency ecosystem, provide a safer and more reliable investment experience for the majority of investors, and strive to become a leader in enhancing market confidence.
